## Contributing Guidelines

### Language Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: All code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and variable names MUST be written in **English only**.

- No Chinese characters in source files, comments, or documentation
- All JSDoc comments must be in English
- All error messages and user-facing strings must be in English
- Commit messages must be in English
- Variable names and function names must use English words

### Code Style

We use TypeScript with strict type checking. Please ensure:

- All code is properly typed
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing Requirements

**All code changes MUST include corresponding test coverage.**

- **Minimum coverage**: 80%
- **Test types required**:
  - Unit tests for individual functions/utilities
  - Integration tests for workflows
  - Command tests for CLI commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific package
npm test -w @yu_robotics/remote-cli

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage -w @yu_robotics/remote-cli

# Run specific test file
npm test -- DirectoryGuard.test.ts
```

### Test-Driven Development

We follow TDD principles:

1. **Write test first** (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our guidelines

3. **Run tests** and ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed:
   - README.md for user-facing changes
   - CLAUDE.md for architecture changes
   - Inline code comments

5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines))

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all CI checks pass
   - Request review from maintainers

### PR Review Criteria

Your PR will be reviewed for:

- Code quality and readability
- Test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Documentation updates
- Adherence to style guidelines
- No breaking changes (unless discussed)

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples

```
feat(cli): add worktree cleanup command

Add /worktree cleanup slash command to remove old worktrees
automatically. Default cleanup threshold is 7 days.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(router): handle WebSocket reconnection gracefully

Prevent crash when WebSocket connection drops unexpectedly.
Add exponential backoff for reconnection attempts.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs: update README with new configuration options

Add documentation for worktree configuration settings.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

Test individual components in isolation:

```typescript
// packages/cli/tests/DirectoryGuard.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { DirectoryGuard } from '../src/security/DirectoryGuard';

describe('DirectoryGuard', () => {
  it('should allow paths within whitelist', () => {
    const guard = new DirectoryGuard(['/home/user/projects']);
    expect(guard.isAllowed('/home/user/projects/my-app')).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflows:

```typescript
// packages/cli/tests/integration/full-workflow.test.ts
describe('Integration: Full Workflow', () => {
  it('should complete init → start → stop workflow', async () => {
    // Test the complete user journey
  });
});
```

### Test Isolation

Tests must be isolated and not depend on each other:

```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import os from 'os';

// Mock os.homedir() for test isolation
vi.spyOn(os, 'homedir').mockImplementation(() => process.env.HOME || os.homedir());
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in relevant `package.json` files
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically publish to npm
